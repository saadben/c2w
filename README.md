# Chat While Watching (c2w)
This is a Python Twisted framework and application protocol implementation
exercise.

## Specification
This repo is an implementation of the protocol written by the group 14.
We didn't choose our own protocol to implement because the sequence number
notion was not clear enough. However, you can find both of the specifications
in this repo.

## UDP and TCP
The UDP part is mainly finished by me, but another group member has also contributed.
We would like to share it with all of you, but the code is not optimized, so I feel happy
if it could help.
The TCP part is written by the other group members, so it's normal that you
can't find it here.
