# Chat While Watching (c2w)
This is a Python Twisted framework and application protocol implementation
exercise.

## Specification
This repo is an implementation of the protocol written by the group 14.
We didn't choose our own protocol to implement because the sequence number
notion was not clear enough. However, you can find both of the specifications
in this repo.

## UDP and TCP
This protocol can be implemented on both UDP and TCP, so you can find that
there are two implementations here.
I would like to share my code with all of you, but the code is not optimized, so I feel happy
if it could help.
