            You must write the implementation of this class.

        Each instance must have at least the following attribute:

        .. attribute:: serverProxy

            The serverProxy, which the protocol must use
            to interact with the user and movie store in the server.

        .. attribute:: clientAddress

            The IP address (or the name) of the c2w server.

        .. attribute:: clientPort

            The port number used by the c2w server.

        .. note::
            You must add attributes and methods to this class in order
            to have a working and complete implementation of the c2w
            protocol.

            The IP address and port number of the client are provided
            only for the sake of completeness, you do not need to use
            them, as a TCP connection is already associated with only
            one client.
